# Election_Analysis

### Overview:
This project displays skill with using the programming language Python to: 

Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays.
Perform mathematical operations.
Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.
Produce screen outputs.
show knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops, and installation of new software.

Completing this project will ideally teach me how to:
Navigate to folders on computer using the command line.
Read and extract data from CSV files.
Determine the difference between Python data types, like integers, floating-point decimal numbers, and strings.
Perform mathematical operations using data types.
Declare variables using different data types.
Create and use data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Create and use decision and repetition statements.
Create and use Boolean and logical operators.
Write data to an output file and print the file.

### Background

The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout

#### Project Details:
This is an audit created for the Colorado Board of Elections in order to report election information regarding the counties, voters, and candidates. 

The report includes:

-Total number of votes cast
-Number of votes from each county
-Percentage of votes from each county
-Overall county voter turnout
-Largest county turnout
-Supposedly the winner of the election (error)
