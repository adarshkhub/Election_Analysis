# Election_Analysis

### Overview:

#### Project Details
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

Calculate the total number of votes cast.
Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
Calculate the amount of votes and percentage per county.
Calculate the counties with the largest county voter turnouts.
Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

#### Project Skills Summary
This project displays skill with using the programming language Python to: 

Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays.
Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code multiple times
produce outputs from our code and store them on our computer
show knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops, and installation of new software.

### Results


The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout

### Analysis

Solid first project which helped understand the basics of python (initializing variables, creating counters, writing loops). Was able to reproduce on google collab.
